A brief summary of Email Validation:- that i just written down below:

Email is use to send and receive emails, block spam, create an address book, and perform other basic email tasks. Gmail also has some unique features, such as spam filtering, conversation view, built-in chat, and call phone.

Email Validation Process:- It is the process of checking if an email address is correctly formatted and deliverable. It involves verifying the syntax, structure, and domain of the email address.

Some of the common conditions of email validation are:-

1. The email address must contain a local part and a domain part separated by an @ symbol. For example, abhinav@example.com, has the local part abhinav, and the domain part is example.com.

2. The local part can contain alphanumeric characters (a-z, 0-9), and some special characters (.,_), but the dot (.) as the first or last character, or two or more consecutive dots. For example, abhinav.gera@example.com is valid, but .abhinav@example.com, abhinav.@example.com, and abhinav...gera@example.com are invalid.

3. The domain part must also have a valid top-level domain (TLD), such as .com, .org, .net, etc. For example, example.com is valid, but example-.com, exampleâ€¦com, and example.b are invalid.

4. The email address must be more or equal to 6 characters or must not exceed the maximum length of 254 characters.
